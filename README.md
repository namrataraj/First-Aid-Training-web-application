## Abstract

The First Aid Training is a web-based application developed with the primary  
objective of promoting essential first aid knowledge and enabling users to respond  
effectively during emergency situations. In many cases, timely and informed first aid  
can significantly reduce the severity of injuries and even save lives. Recognizing this  
critical need, the project aims to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform that  
educates individuals about first aid through interactive scenarios, quizzes, and  
progress tracking.  
The project utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Django  
to create a responsive and interactive web interface. The application features modules  
such as user authentication, scenario-based learning, quizzes for assessment,  
achievement tracking, and a leaderboard to foster engagement and motivation. The  
backend is structured to store user profiles, quiz performance, and progress data  
securely.  
The methodology involved identifying key first aid situations, designing  
corresponding learning modules, and implementing dynamic features to make the  
learning process both informative and engaging. User-friendly navigation and visual  
elements enhance accessibility and usability for a broad audience.  
The result is a comprehensive training tool that can be used by students, educational  
institutions, and the general public to increase awareness and preparedness in  
emergency situations. This platform not only educates users but also promotes  
consistent learning and retention through gamified elements and a structured  
approach.
