## ðŸ“– Abstract

The First Aid Training is a web-based application developed with the primary objective of promoting essential first aid knowledge and enabling users to respond effectively during emergency situations. In many cases, timely and informed first aid can significantly reduce the severity of injuries and even save lives. Recognizing this critical need, the project aims to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform that educates individuals about first aid through interactive scenarios, quizzes, and progress tracking.

The project utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Django to create a responsive and interactive web interface. The application features modules such as user authentication, scenario-based learning, quizzes for assessment, achievement tracking, and a leaderboard to foster engagement and motivation. The backend is structured to store user profiles, quiz performance, and progress data securely.

The methodology involved identifying key first aid situations, designing corresponding learning modules, and implementing dynamic features to make the learning process both informative and engaging. User-friendly navigation and visual elements enhance accessibility and usability for a broad audience.

The result is a comprehensive training tool that can be used by students, educational institutions, and the general public to increase awareness and preparedness in emergency situations. This platform not only educates users but also promotes consistent learning and retention through gamified elements and a structured approach.
